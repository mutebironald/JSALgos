# Definition

- Acombination of nodes and connections between those nodes.(simple definition)
- (Another definition)A set of nodes(vertices) together with a set of unordered pairs of these nodes(vertices) for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

## uses of Graphs

- social Networks
- Location/ Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System optimizations

### Types of graphs

- unweighted graphs
- weighted graphs
- directed graphs
- undirected graphs

#### Storing Graphs

- Adjacency Matrix { - takes up more space , - Slower to iterate over all edges, - Faster to look up specific edge }
- Adjancency List {- can take up less space, - Faster to iterate over all edges - can be slower to look up specific edge }
