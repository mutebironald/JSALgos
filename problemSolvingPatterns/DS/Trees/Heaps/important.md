# Heaps are a special type of trees

in a max binary heap, parent node is always larger than child nodes
in a min binary heap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

Max binary heap

- Each parent has atmost 2 child nodes
- The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
- in a max binary heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be
  and left children are filled out most
